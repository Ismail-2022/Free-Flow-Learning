**Free Flow Learning**
Welcome to Free Flow Learning, a platform designed to provide an interactive and engaging learning experience for students in the fields of Physics, Biology, and Chemistry. With our Oculus Quest 2 integration, students can dive into the world of science and enhance their understanding through immersive models and quizzes. Let's take a closer look at what our platform offers:

Features:
Physics Model: Bohr Atomic Model


Explore the fundamentals of atomic structure with our interactive Bohr Atomic Model. Using the Oculus Quest 2, students can interact with the model and attempt a timed test. Their speed in completing the model determines their grading, encouraging quick thinking and learning.

Chemistry Model: Periodic Table Challenge

Dive into the fascinating world of chemistry with our Periodic Table Challenge. Five random elements are spawned, and students must place them in their respective positions on the periodic table. Their accuracy and efficiency in completing this task are reflected in their grades.

Biology Model: (To be developed)

We are actively working on a Biology Model to enrich the learning experience further. Stay tuned for updates!

Leaderboard

Students can track their progress and compare their performance with others through the leaderboard. The top 5 students in each subject are showcased, creating healthy competition and motivation for improvement.

Authentication

To access the platform's features, students need to log in or register. This ensures a personalized learning experience and allows them to save their progress across multiple sessions.

Admin Panel

Our platform includes an admin panel for teachers and administrators. With this panel, they can access various tools, including a detailed report section.

Progress Graphs

Admins can view detailed reports on each student's progress, displayed in the form of informative graphs. This feature helps teachers track individual performances and identify areas that require additional attention.
